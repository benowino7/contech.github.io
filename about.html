            <h2>Just About Me</h2>
            <strong>
                <p>Technology is the epitome of innovation. From one day to the next, it can be vastly different.
                    Revolutionary
                    new products, software,
                    and systems are constantly being launched into the market.
                    Technology is always moving forward and there’s some anticipation and excitement that comes with
                    waiting for
                    what new innovation will
                    be born in the tech world—especially when you get to be a part of it, right in the middle of the
                    action.
                    Technology careers can pay extremely well, especially when you have the right education to back up
                    your
                    skills.
                    Even entry-level jobs will pay you well over the national average, which means you can secure your
                    financial
                    future early on in your
                    career.</p>
