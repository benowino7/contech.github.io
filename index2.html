                <h3>How garbage is managed in Kenya</h3>

                <p>Uncollected solid waste is one of Nairobi’s most visible environmental problems. Many parts of the
                    city,
                    especially the low and middle-income areas, don’t even have waste collection systems in place. In
                    high income areas,
                    private waste collection companies are booming. Residents pay handsomely without really knowing
                    where the waste will end up.
                    The Nairobi county government has acknowledged that with 2,475 tons of waste being produced each
                    day,
                    it can’t manage. Addis Ababa Ethiopia has a similar size population but only generates 1,680 tons
                    per day.</p>

                <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"

                <p>Since the main source of garbage is each house hold, the system is desined in such a way that the
                    house hold send atext to an ssd
                    code availed for them on place, phone number and identification which will be recorded by the
                    system. Then the system broadcasts
                    this message to the available garbage collectors who colect the garbage for recycles around.</p>
                <p>There are four types of paragraphs that you need to know about: descriptive, narrative, expository,
                    and persuasive. A quick search around the internet will yield other types, but to keep this simple,
                    it's a good idea to consider just these four.

                    the descriptive paragraph: This type of paragraph describes something and shows the reader what a
                    thing or a person is like. The words chosen in the description often appeal to the five senses of
                    touch, smell, sight, sound, and taste. Descriptive paragraphs can be artistic and may deviate from
                    grammatical norms.

                    the narrative paragraph: This type of paragraph tells a story. There's a sequence of action or
                    there's a clear beginning, middle, and end to the paragraph.

                    the expository paragraph: This type of paragraph explains something or provides instruction. It
                    could also describe a process and move the reader step by step through a method. This type of
                    paragraph often requires research, but it's possible that the writer is able to rely on his or her
                    own knowledge and expertise.

                    the persuasive paragraph: This type of paragraph tries to get the reader to accept a particular
                    point of view or understand the writer's position. This is the type of paragraph that many teachers
                    focus on because it's useful when building an argument. It often requires the collection of facts
                    and research.

                    It important to point out that many paragraphs are a combination of these four types, but for the
                    purpose of instruction, let's consider some examples of each:

                    This is a descriptive paragraph:

                    The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing
                    yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by
                    minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word . The groups change more swiftly,
                    swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers,
                    confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become from a sharp,
                    joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change
                    of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.

                    This excerpt is taken from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In this paragraph you can hear,
                    see, and feel the setting in which the story takes place. When you practice writing a descriptive
                    paragraph yourself, you should address all aspects of the physical world. </p>
                <h3>The nature</h3>
                <p>My name is Benson de OWino. I am a scientist with an academic background in ecology and environmental
                    science currently living in Southwest Florida. This includes sea turtle field work in Mexico, Costa
                    Rica, and Ghana. I find the natural world fascinating and enjoy sharing my experiences and knowledge
                    of science and nature with others. I consider myself an ecological storyteller: sharing stories
                    about nature in more informal settings and presenting them in a way that makes the information
                    relatable to people without a science background. I have previous experience with this working as a
                    Docent at the Conservancy of SW Florida in Naples and the Everglades Wonder Gardens in Bonita
                    Springs.</p>
                <p>Fireflies glow due to a chemical process know as bioluminescence. While visually similar to
                    phosphorescence (the process exhibited by most common ‘glow-in-the-dark’ objects), the two are quite
                    distinct. The latter simply involves a substance absorbing energy and then slowly releasing it over
                    time in the form of light. Bioluminescence is much more similar in its process to a glow stick in
                    that light is emitted as the product of a chemical reaction, but it is still slightly different
                    because it must be catalyzed by an enzyme.
                    Bioluminescent enzymes are known by the generic term ‘luciferase’. They catalyze a chemical redox
                    reaction that occurs to a light-emitting molecule or ‘luciferin’. In each reaction, the luciferin is
                    oxidized and loses electrons. This process emits light. The structure of the various luciferins is
                    relatively similar between bioluminescent species, but the luciferase enzymes are much more diverse.
                    Genetic evidence from the codes for these proteins indicates multiple independent developments of
                    bioluminescence throughout evolutionary history (a minimum of 40 separate times).</p>
