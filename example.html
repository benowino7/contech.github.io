                    <p>Soccer is played at all levels throughout the world from small kids leagues to professional and
                        international teams.
                        Perhaps the most famous soccer tournament is the World Cup.
                        Held every four years, the World Cup is a soccer competition among countries and is one of the
                        most
                        watched events in the world.
                        One of the reasons soccer is so popular is that it really only takes a ball and a flat open area
                        to
                        play.
                        Kids throughout the world will make up fields and goals just about anywhere and start playing
                        the
                        game.
                        The game is also fun and competitive.
                        Soccer is a great form of exercise as there is lots of running for good distances.
                        The sport is also a good test of dexterity and a great way to learn balance.

                        src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1752757/pexels-photo-1752757.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500">
                    <p> When a team makes a basket, they score two points and the ball goes to the other team. If a
                        basket,
                        or field goal,
                        is made outside of the three-point arc, then that basket is worth three points. A free throw is
                        worth one point.
                        Free throws are awarded to a team according
                        to some formats involving the number of fouls committed in a half and/or the type of foul
                        committed.
                        Fouling a shooter always results in two or three free throws being awarded the shooter,
                        depending
                        upon where he was when he shot.
                        If he was beyond the three-point line, then he gets three shots.
                        Other types of fouls do not result in free throws being awarded until a certain number have
                        accumulated during a half.
                        Once that number is reached, then the player who was fouled is awarded a '1-and-1' opportunity.
                        If
                        he makes his first free throw,
                        he gets to attempt a second. If he misses the first shot, the ball is live on the rebound.

                    <p>American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as
                        gridiron,[nb 1]
                        is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at
                        each
                        end. The offense,
                        the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by
                        running
                        with the ball or passing it,
                        while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance
                        and
                        to take control of the ball for themselves.
                        The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over
                        the
                        football to the defense,
                        but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are
                        scored
                        primarily by advancing the ball into
                        the opposing team's end zone for a
                        touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with
                        the
                        most points at the end of a game wins.

                <!-- <p> Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of
                    Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state,
                    officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Following
                    World War I after declaring its
                    neutrality in 1914, when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916,
                    Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania as well as
                    parts of Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. In
                    June–August 1940, as a consequence of the
                    Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and
                    Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union,
                    and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and,
                    consequently, in June 1941 entered
                    World War II on the Axis side, fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it joined
                    the Allies and recovered Northern
                    Transylvania. Following the war, under the occupation of the Red Army's forces, Romania became a
                    socialist republic and member of the
                    Warsaw Pact.
